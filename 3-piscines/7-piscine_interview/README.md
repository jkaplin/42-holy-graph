## Piscine Starfleet

This piscine is an introduction to technical interviews.
It will cover the basics required for an interview and
give you a good starting point to further prepare for technical interviews.

*Disclaimer: I've fixed a lot of the exercises, and made new solutions
to previous ones that I didn't completed during my piscine.
These scores don't show the final mark of this repository.*
